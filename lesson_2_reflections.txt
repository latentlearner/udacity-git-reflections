What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Upon initializing a repository, git creates a .git folder to track the history of the files in that folder.
	It does not start tracking anything unless you commit.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	A staging area is a temporary hold for files that we are planning to commit.
	It might not contain all the files in the working directory and will add new files to the repository in a single commit.
	It helps plan and segregate logical sections of the repository when commiting.
