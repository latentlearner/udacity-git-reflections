What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Upon initializing a repository, git creates a .git folder to track the history of the files in that folder.
	It does not start tracking anything unless you commit.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	A staging area is a temporary hold for files that we are planning to commit.
	It might not contain all the files in the working directory and will add new files to the repository in a single commit.
	It helps plan and segregate logical sections of the repository when commiting.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	Staging area can be ensure that even while working on multiple files, only the logically grouped ones are the ones that get committed

How do diagrams help you visualize branch structure?
	Diagrams help by giving a snapshot of all the branches in the repo. We can see the relationships and sometimes work out the logical reasons these branches were created.
	Understanding the parallel development branches helps with understanding the structure and changes over time.
