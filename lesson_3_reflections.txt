When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you want to share and collaborate or work from multiple machines. When you need a reliable backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  I would not want Git to overwrite my work without asking. Also, merging at a logical place in development is upto the dev to decide.
  More control over when to pull changes from others leads to better collaboration overall.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Forks: are copies of repositories from other users that we own and can manipulate
  Clones: are local copies of repositories from a remote GitHub repository
  Branches: are versions of code/files in the same repository.
